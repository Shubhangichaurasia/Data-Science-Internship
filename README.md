## 📂 Project Showcase

### 1. 🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction (Regression)
* **Objective:** Predict housing prices based on features like square footage and number of bedrooms.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression), Matplotlib.
* **Key Achievement:** Built a Linear Regression model that successfully identified the correlation between property size and market value, visualizing the results with regression lines.
* **[View Code](./Task_1_HousePrediction)**

### 2. 📈 Financial Time-Series Data Pipeline
* **Objective:** Clean and preprocess raw stock market data for algorithmic trading models.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, DateTime.
* **Key Achievement:** Engineered a robust data pipeline that handled missing values using Forward Fill, filtered specifically for Apple (AAPL) stock, and normalized high-variance volume data using MinMax Scaling.
* **[View Code](./Task_2_Stock_Preprocessing)**

### 3. 🌸 Iris Species Classification
* **Objective:** Automate the classification of Iris flower species based on botanical measurements.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-Learn (K-Nearest Neighbors).
* **Key Achievement:** Achieved **100% accuracy** using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, demonstrating proficiency in model training and hyperparameter tuning.
* **[View Code](./Task_3_Iris_KNN)**

### 4. 🌳 Interpretable AI: Decision Tree Visualization
* **Objective:** Create a "White Box" model to explain the logic behind classification decisions.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-Learn (Decision Trees), Matplotlib.
* **Key Achievement:** Visualized the decision-making process of the model, generating a flowchart that mapped specific feature thresholds (e.g., *Petal Length < 2.45*) to final predictions.
* **[View Code](./Task_4_Iris_DecisionTree)**

### 5. 📉 Customer Churn Prediction
* **Objective:** Predict customer attrition to help businesses improve retention strategies.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression), LabelEncoder.
* **Key Achievement:** Processed business data using Label Encoding for categorical variables and achieved **~85% accuracy** in predicting whether a customer would leave or stay.
* **[View Code](./Task_5_Churn_Prediction)**

### 6. 😃 Fine-Grained Emotion Recognition (NLP)
* **Objective:** Analyze unstructured text data to detect complex emotional states.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, TF-IDF Vectorization, Support Vector Machines (SVM).
* **Key Achievement:** Built an NLP pipeline capable of distinguishing between **279 unique emotions** (e.g., Euphoria, Melancholy) using TF-IDF for text vectorization, performing significantly better than random baselines on a complex multi-class problem.
* **[View Code](./Task_6_Sentiment_SVM)**
