📂 Project Portfolio (Data Science & Machine Learning)
1. Real Estate Price Prediction (Regression Analysis)
Objective: Predicted housing prices based on features like square footage and number of bedrooms.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression), Matplotlib.

Key Achievement: Built a Linear Regression model that successfully identified the correlation between property size and market value, visualizing the results with regression lines.

2. Financial Time-Series Data Pipeline (Data Engineering)
Objective: Cleaned and preprocessed raw stock market data for algorithmic trading models.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, DateTime.

Key Achievement: Engineered a robust data pipeline that handled missing values using Forward Fill, filtered specifically for Apple (AAPL) stock, and normalized high-variance volume data using MinMax Scaling.

3. Iris Species Classification (Supervised Learning)
Objective: Automated the classification of Iris flower species based on botanical measurements.

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-Learn (K-Nearest Neighbors).

Key Achievement: Achieved 100% accuracy using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, demonstrating proficiency in model training and hyperparameter tuning.

4. Interpretable AI: Decision Tree Visualization
Objective: Created a "White Box" model to explain the logic behind classification decisions.

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-Learn (Decision Trees), Matplotlib.

Key Achievement: Visualized the decision-making process of the model, generating a flowchart that mapped specific feature thresholds (e.g., Petal Length < 2.45) to final predictions.

5. Customer Churn Prediction (Business Analytics)
Objective: Predicted customer attrition to help businesses improve retention strategies.

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression), LabelEncoder.

Key Achievement: Processed business data using Label Encoding for categorical variables and achieved ~85% accuracy in predicting whether a customer would leave or stay.

6. Fine-Grained Emotion Recognition (NLP)
Objective: Analyzed unstructured text data to detect complex emotional states.

Tech Stack: Python, TF-IDF Vectorization, Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Key Achievement: Built an NLP pipeline capable of distinguishing between 279 unique emotions (e.g., Euphoria, Melancholy) using TF-IDF for text vectorization, performing significantly better than random baselines on a complex multi-class problem.
